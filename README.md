# Centurion

Centurion is a small wrapper library for [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php), written in C++. The main purpose of Centurion is to provide an object-oriented take on SDL2, which is originally a C library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
As previously mentioned, Centurion is a wrapper library for SDL, meaning of course that SDL is necessary.

The following are the versions of SDL that Centurion is based upon.
- SDL2 version:       2.0.9
- SDL2_image version: 2.0.4
- SDL2_mixer version: 2.0.4
- SDL2_ttf version:   2.0.15

### Installing
If you've previously configured SDL or something similiar with Visual Studio, installing Centurion won't be very difficult. There are quite some steps to be taken though.

## Built With
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The IDE used.
