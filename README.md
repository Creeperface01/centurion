## What is Centurion?

Centurion is a modern C++ library built on top of SDL2 in order to improve type-safety, memory safety and overall ease-of-use. It can be used for creating windows, 2D-rendering, keyboard input, mouse input, sound effects, music, etc. In other words, most of the things you can do with SDL2. In addition to this, all Centurion components are built to support being used alongside the SDL2 components so that you can use SDL2 for the things that Centurion doesn't cover.

## Documentation

Documentation is extremely important. Therefore, Centurion is meticulously documented. Documentation is available in-source (Doxygen) and on Read-the-Docs.

The Doxygen documentation for the latest release is hosted through GitHub Pages, found [here](https://albin-johansson.github.io/Centurion/). The Doxygen documentation is much more technical and detailed than the Read-the-Docs documentation, useful for looking up details for various entities in the library.

The Read-the-Docs documentation is less detailed. Instead, it provides tutorials, examples and a general overview of the Centurion library. It can be found [here](https://centurion.readthedocs.io)!

## Why use Centurion?

Centurion is written in modern C++17 and as such is much more intuitive and easy to use that raw SDL2, which is written in C. No need to worry about memory leaks and ownership of resources! By using Centurion you will write code that is type-safe, clear and efficient.

Happy coding! :heart:
