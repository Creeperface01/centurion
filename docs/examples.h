/**
 * \page page-examples Examples
 *
 * This page lists all of the available examples that demonstrate various aspects of the
 * Centurion library. Some of these examples will be very simple if you have any previous
 * experience working with SDL, but they can still be useful to get a notion of how the
 * APIs are meant to be used. The examples are roughly organized in regards to increasing
 * difficulty, even if none of them are necessarily particularly difficult.
 *
