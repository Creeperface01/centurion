About Centurion
---------------
Centurion is a modern C++ library built on top of SDL2 in order to improve
type-safety, memory safety and overall ease-of-use. It can be used for
creating windows, 2D-rendering, keyboard input, mouse input, sound effects,
music, etc. In other words, most of the things you can do with SDL2!

Why use Centurion?
------------------
Centurion is written in modern C++17, which means that the API is much more
expressive, type-safe and easy-to-use than raw SDL2, which is written in C.
By using Centurion effectively, there's no need to worry about memory leaks and
ownership of  resources! By using Centurion you will write type-safe, expressive
and efficient code.
