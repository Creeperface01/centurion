/**
 * \page page-faq FAQ
 *
 * Here you'll find answers to some of the questions that you might have about the
 * Centurion library.
 *
 * \section faq-cpp-versions What versions of C++ does Centurion support?
 * C++17 or better. Centurion 5 and 6 are written in C++17, with support for use in C++20
 * projects. Additionally, since 6.2.0, Centurion makes full use of any available C++20
 * facilities, such as `std::format`, etc.
 *
 * \section faq-use-cases What is Centurion meant to be used for?
 * The use cases are the same as for SDL, so mainly game development.
 *
 * \section faq-feature-x Why is feature X from SDL not covered in Centurion?
 * The most likely reason is that it would be redundant. In general, the library has
 * been quite generous with including aspects of SDL that have some overlap with the STL,
 * such as with the `thread` class. However, if you feel a feature is unnecessarily
 * missing, feel free to request it!
 *
 * \section faq-license What am I allowed to do with Centurion?
 * Pretty much anything as long as the license is kept with the source code. Centurion is
 * distributed under the MIT license.
 *
 * \section faq-contribution Can I contribute to Centurion?
 * Yes! Anyone can make pull requests and suggest improvements, new features and/or bug
 * fixes.
